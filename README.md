Welcome to the Spec-Driven Development project! ðŸ‘‹

This project contains instructions for a structured, step-by-step approach to building software using modern AI
assistants. It's all part of the **spec-driven development movement** that's taking the dev space by storm!

The guides here are written for AI-powered agentic frameworks. While they can be used with many tools like **Aider** or
**Claude Code**, they are primarily designed for **GitHub Agent mode**.

### The Development Journey

Follow the numbered specs in the `instructions` directory to see how an idea evolves from a requirement to a fully
documented piece of software.

1. **Overview**: `instructions/SPEC-0-OVERVIEW.md`
2. **Requirements**: `instructions/SPEC-1-REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. **Design**: `instructions/SPEC-2-DESIGN.md`
4. **Implementation**: `instructions/SPEC-3-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
5. **Testing**: `instructions/SPEC-4-TESTING.md`
6. **Documentation**: `instructions/SPEC-5-DOCUMENTATION.md`

Happy coding! âœ¨
