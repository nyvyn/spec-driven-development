Welcome to Spec-Driven Development! ðŸ‘‹

This project contains instructions for a structured, step-by-step approach to building software using modern AI
assistants. It's all part of the **spec-driven development movement** that's taking the dev space by storm!

The guides here are written for AI-powered agentic frameworks. While they can be used with many tools like **Aider** or
**Claude Code**, they are primarily designed for **GitHub Agent mode**.

### Getting Started

This repository includes guidelines and templates for structured software development:

- **AGENTS.md**: Repository standards and feature specification workflow templates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Instructions for AI assistants working with this codebase (pointer to AGENTS.md)

These files provide the foundation for spec-driven development, helping you create comprehensive feature specifications
that evolve from requirements to fully documented software.

Happy coding! âœ¨
